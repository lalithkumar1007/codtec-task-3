Description:
During my one-month internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I worked on developing and enhancing user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I contributed to the creation of responsive, accessible, and modern web pages, collaborating with design and backend teams to ensure seamless integration. This experience sharpened my skills in frontend frameworks, improved my eye for UI/UX design, and reinforced my problem-solving approach in real-world development environments

This program is a basic personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. It serves as an online showcase of a developer’s skills, background, and featured projects.
The webpage includes key sections:
- Header with the developer’s name and role.
- About Me section to introduce the developer and share a short bio.
- Projects section highlighting sample works with titles and brief descriptions.
- Footer for contact information.
Styling is handled using CSS to create a responsive, clean, and professional layout. The design uses modern UI techniques like content cards, centered sections, and soft shadows for visual appeal.
